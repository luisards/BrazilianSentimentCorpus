# BrazilianSentimentCorpus
Mini-project for the Linguistic Corpus Annotation course at the University of Tübingen, Winter semester 2020/2021.

# Goals
- Create a corpus of tweets in Portuguese (non-standard language)
- Consider the current political and social context in Brazil (2020/2021)
- Contribute to the field of hate speech detection
- Analyze the linguistic differences between offensive and not offensive language
- Analyze the different ways offensive language is expressed

# Data
- Downloaded replies to news regarding the LGBTQIA+ community, politics, race, religion and women. 
- Data acquired from the four biggest Brazilian news outlets: Estadão, Folha, G1 and O Globo.

# Results
- Two different corpora for different purposes:
  - A CSV dataset with polarity and sentiment annotations
  - A WebAnno TSV dataset with POS, dependency and sentence-level polarity and sentiment annotations 

# Future work
- Expand corpus
- Equalize class distribution (the data is currently imbalanced)
- Add irony annotation
- Consider emojis
- Develop a more refined annotation scheme (offensive/hate speech)
